# Metadata / Audit / Data

Audit is a feature set in the Metadata utility component.
  
Classes in this Data folder implement data access for this feature set. This is the persistence layer for Audit.

## Future Schema Changes

When time and opportunity permit, the following database schema changes should be considered, to improve alignment with current database naming conventions:

* Rename table from `t_origin` to ``.
* Rename table from `t_version` to ``.
