# Security / Identification / Data

Identification is a feature set in the Security utility component.
  
Classes in this Data folder implement data access for this feature set. This is the persistence layer for Identification.

## Future Schema Changes

When time and opportunity permit, the following database schema changes should be considered, to improve alignment with current database naming conventions:

* Rename table from `t_organization` to ``.
* Rename table from `t_partition` to ``.
* Rename table from `t_password` to ``.
* Rename table from `t_role` to ``.
* Rename table from `t_secret` to ``.
