# Security / Authorization / Data

Authorization is a feature set in the Security utility component.
  
Classes in this Data folder implement data access for this feature set. This is the persistence layer for Authorization.

## Future Schema Changes

When time and opportunity permit, the following database schema changes should be considered, to improve alignment with current database naming conventions:

* Rename table from `t_permission` to ``.
* Rename table from `t_resource` to ``.
